Cleaning: Trim text fields and replace tab characters with spaces for all address, name, and descriptive columns.

Standardization: Pad profile_number and rpn with leading zeros to 13 digits and prefix with PN; normalize tax_id, state_code, and organization type values.

Derivation: Set system and client defaults (system_name = ERM, client_type = N), derive contact types from LAN IDs, and apply regulatory flags.
